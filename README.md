# About Me
	## My Interests
		My current interests are watching true crime documentaries, collecting mystery box toys and also spending times with my cats. I think my most favorite one is collecting mystery box toys. It is a money drain, but I like the thrill of being both curious and surprised of what may be inside. 

		
	## Websites I Recommend
		* [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com) - I personally enjoy this website because there are many youtube channels where I can watch informational videos about true crime.
		*[Rate My Professors] (https://www.ratemyprofessors.com) - I find this website interesting because this gives professors ratings from students who have personally experienced their courses. I use this site every semester before I chose my courses.
